Our project is all about giving employment to the illiterate peoples and daily wage workers. Because when in our country lockdown was imposed many workers went back to their villages and hometowns, and it was difficult for them to find work after the lockdown. So, to solve this problem we developed an application for them to find work on their finger-tip. It overcame the lack of communication between the work provider and the worker.
